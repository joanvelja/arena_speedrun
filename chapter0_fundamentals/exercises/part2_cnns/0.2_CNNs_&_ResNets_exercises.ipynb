These are usually added to the instance with something like `self.attribute = attr`, where `attr` might be provided as an argument. Some modules are simple enough that they don't need any persistent attributes, and in this case you can skip the `__init__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `forward` method is called on each forward pass of the `Module`, possibly using the attributes that were set up in the `__init__`. It should take in the input, do whatever it's supposed to do, and return the result. Subclassing `nn.Module` automatically makes instances of your class callable, so you can do `model(x)` on an input `x` to invoke the `forward` method."

You might want to take this opportunity to print out useful invariant information about the module. The Python built-in function `getattr` might be helpful here (it can be used e.g. as `getattr(self, \"arg1\")`, which returns the same as `self.arg1` would).

    "\n",
    "ReLU is defined as the element-wise maximum between the input and a tensor of zeros. It's one of the simplest types of **nonlinear activation functions**. These are essential because linear operations compose to make more linear operations, which is very limiting. On the other hand, the **universal approximation theorem** tells us that we can approximate any continuous function using a sufficiently large neural network, if we use nonlinear activation functions. It's worth emphasizing that the theory of the UAT and what networks look like in practice are very different - in particular, many versions of the UAT are based on a shallow but extremely wide neural network, on the other hand most of the power of modern neural networks comes from their ability to compose between layers: feeding the output of one layer into the input of another, and create increasingly expressive functions. We'll explore this idea more when we study circuits in next week's interpretability material."

    "Now implement your own `Linear` module. This applies a simple linear transformation, with a weight matrix and optional bias vector. The PyTorch documentation page is [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html). Note that this is the first `Module` you'll implement that has learnable weights and biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Question - what type do you think these variables should be?</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "They have to be `torch.Tensor` objects wrapped in `nn.Parameter` in order for `nn.Module` to recognize them. If you forget to do this, `module.parameters()` won't include your `Parameter`, which prevents an optimizer from being able to modify it during training.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Also, in tomorrow's exercises we'll be building a ResNet and loading in weights from a pretrained model, and this is hard to do if you haven't registered all your parameters!\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "For any layer, initialization is very important for the stability of training: with a bad initialization, your model will take much longer to converge or may completely fail to learn anything. The default PyTorch behavior isn't necessarily optimal and you can often improve performance by using something more custom, but we'll follow it for today because it's simple and works decently well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each float in the weight and bias tensors are drawn independently from the uniform distribution on the interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bigg[-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_{in}}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_{in}}}\\bigg]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N_{in}$ is the number of inputs contributing to each output value. The rough intuition for this is that it keeps the variance of the activations at each layer constant, since each one is calculated by taking the sum over $N_{in}$ inputs multiplied by the weights (and standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables scales as the square root of number of variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "This initialization technique is called **uniform Kaiming initialization**. A few last notes on initialization methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kaiming often has a different constant in the numerator depending on what the target variance is, also there are uniform & normal variants of it (we'll only be using the uniform variant)\n",
    "- **Xavier initialization** is the other well-known technique, and differs in that it uses $N_{in} + N_{out}$ in the denominator (this makes sense when also considering variance scaling of backward passes as well as forward passes - see the next dropdown for technical details)\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Technical details (derivation of distribution)</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key intuition behind Kaiming initialisation (and others like it) is that we want the variance of our activations to be the same through all layers of the model when we initialize. Suppose $x$ and $y$ are activations from two adjacent layers, and $w$ are the weights connecting them (so we have $y_i = \\sum_j w_{ij} x_j + b_i$, where $b$ is the bias). With $N_{x}$ as the number of neurons in layer $x$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "& =\\sum_j \\operatorname{Var}\\left(w_{i j}\\right) \\cdot \\operatorname{Var}\\left(x_j\\right) \\quad \\text { Variance of product of independent RVs with zero mean is product of variances } \\\\\n",
    "& = N_x \\cdot \\sigma_x^2 \\cdot \\operatorname{Var}\\left(w_{i j}\\right) \\quad \\text { Variance equal for all } N_x \\text { neurons, call this value } \\sigma_x^2\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For this to be the same as $\\sigma_x^2$, we need $\\operatorname{Var}(w_{ij}) = \\frac{1}{N_x}$, so the standard deviation is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_x}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not exactly the case for the Kaiming uniform distribution (which has variance $\\frac{12}{(2 \\sqrt{N_x})^2} = \\frac{3}{N_x}$), and as far as I'm aware there's no principled reason why PyTorch does this. But the most important thing is that the variance scales as $O(1 / N_x)$, rather than what the exact scaling constant is.\n",

The code above demonstrates iteration over the dataset & dataloader respectively, showing how the first element in the dataloader's first batch equals the first element in the dataset (note that this wouldn't be true for the training set, because we've shuffled it).\n",

    "It's common to see batch sizes which are powers of two. The motivation is for efficient GPU utilisation, since processor architectures are normally organised around powers of 2, and computational efficiency is often increased by having the items in each batch split across processors. Or at least, that's the idea. The truth is a bit more complicated, and some studies dispute whether it actually saves time, so at this point it's more of a standard convention than a hard rule which will always lead to more efficient training.\n",

    "\n",
    "You might have seen some blue progress bars running when you first downloaded your MNIST data. These were generated using a library called `tqdm`, which is also a really useful tool when training models or running any process that takes a long period of time.\n",

    "- If you define the progress bar `pbar = tqdm(...)` before your iteration, then you have the option of adding extra information to it using `pbar.set_description` or `pbar.set_postfix`\n",
    "- You can specify the total number of iterations with `tqdm(iterable, total=...)`; this is actually very important when the iterable is something like `enumerate(...)` which doesn't have a length attribute, since tqdm will usually try and infer the total from calling `len` on the iterable you pass it.\n",

For now, [this page](https://wandb.ai/wandb/common-ml-errors/reports/How-To-Use-GPU-with-PyTorch---VmlldzozMzAxMDk) should provide a basic overview of how to use your GPU. A few things to be aware of here:\n",

    "* Errors from having one tensor on cpu and another on cuda are very common. Some useful practices to avoid this:\n",
    "    * Throw in assert statements, to make sure tensors are on the same device\n",
    "    * Remember that when you initialise an array (e.g. with `t.zeros` or `t.arange`), it will be on CPU by default.\n",
    "    * Tensor methods like [`new_zeros`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.new_zeros.html) or [`new_full`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.new_full.html) are useful, because they'll create tensors which match the device and dtype of the base tensor.\n",

    "\n",
    "The batch size is the number of samples in each batch (i.e. the number of samples we feed into the model at once). While training our model, we differentiate with respect to the average loss over all samples in the batch (so a smaller batch usually means the loss is more noisy). However, if you're working with large models, then often having a batch size too large will result in a memory error. This will be relevant for models later on in the course, but for now we're working with very small models so this isn't an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we get our training set, via the helper function `get_mnist`. This helper function used `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to load in data, and then (optionally) the `torch.utils.data.Subset` function to return a subset of this data. Don't worry about the details of this function, it's not the kind of thing you'll need to know by heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then define our optimizer, using `torch.optim.Adam`. The `torch.optim` module gives a wide variety of modules, such as Adam, SGD, and RMSProp. Adam is generally the most popular and seen as the most effective in the majority of cases. We'll discuss optimizers in more detail tomorrow, but for now it's enough to understand that the optimizer calculates the amount to update parameters by (as a function of those parameters' gradients, and sometimes other inputs), and performs this update step. The first argument passed to our optimizer is the parameters of our model (because these are the values that will be updated via gradient descent), and you can also pass keyword arguments to the optimizer which change its behaviour (e.g. the learning rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we have the actual training loop. We iterate through our training data, and for each batch we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate our model on the batch of data, to get the logits for our class predictions,\n",
    "2. Calculate the loss between our logits and the true class labels,\n",
    "3. Backpropagate the loss through our model (this step accumulates gradients in our model parameters),\n",
    "4. Step our optimizer, which is what actually updates the model parameters,\n",
    "5. Zero the gradients of our optimizer, ready for the next step."

    "Sometimes, when we have a lot of different input parameters to our model, it can be helpful to use dataclasses to keep track of them all. Dataclasses are a special kind of class which come with built-in methods for initialising and printing (i.e. no need to define an `__init__` or `__repr__`). Another advantage of using them is autocompletion: when you type in `args.` in VSCode, you'll get a dropdown of all your different dataclass attributes, which can be useful when you've forgotten what you called a variable!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how we might rewrite our training code above using dataclasses. We've wrapped all the training code inside a single argument called `train`, which takes a `SimpleMLPTrainingArgs` object as its only argument."

    "Here are a few tips to help you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You'll need a dataloader for the testset, just like we did for the trainset. It doesn't matter whether you shuffle the testset or not, because we're not updating our model parameters during validation (we usually set `shuffle=False` for testsets).\n",
    "    * You can set the same batch size as for your training set (we'll discuss more optimal choices for this later in the course).\n",
    "* During the validation step, you should be measuring **accuracy**, which is defined as **the fraction of correctly classified images**.\n",
    "    * Note that (unlike loss) accuracy should only be logged after you've gone through the whole validation set. This is because your model doesn't update between computing different accuracies, so it doesn't make sense to log all of them separately.\n",
    "    * Computing accuracy is meant to be a very short operation, so you shouldn't need a progress bar.\n",
    "    * You can wrap your forward pass in `with t.inference_mode():` to make sure that your model is in inference mode during validation (i.e. gradients don't propagate)."

    "A convolution is an operation which takes a kernel and slides it across the input, applying the kernel to each patch of the input. We can view it as a logical extension of the linear layer, except rather than having every output value being determined as a linear combination of every input value, we have a **prior of locality** - assuming that the input has some spatial structure, and each output value should only be determined by a small patch of the input. The kernel contains our learned weights, and we slide that kernel across our input, with each output value being computed by a sumproduct of the kernel values and the corresponding patch in the input. Note that we use all input channels when computing each output value, which means the sumproduct is over `kernel_length * in_channels` elements (or `kernel_width * kernel_height * in_channels` when, as is most often the case, we're using 2D kernels)."

    "- **Stride** - the distance the kernel moves each time it is applied.\n",
    "- **Padding** - the number of pixels we pad around the input on each side.\n",
    "- **Output channels** - the number of separate kernels of shape `(in_channels, kernel_width, kernel_height)` we apply to the input. Each separate kernel has different learned weights, and will produce a separate output channel.\n",

We refer to this as a **shape-preserving convolution**, because the input & output dimensions for width/height are the same.

Interestingly, this post philosophically underpins quite a lot of the current interpretability field - even though the focus has primarily shifted from vision models to language models, many of the underlying ideas remain the same.\n",

If this is true then we do set the right branch to be the identity (that's what the \"OPTIONAL\" annotation refers to), but if this isn't true then we set the right branch to be a 1x1 convolution with stride `first_stride`, zero padding, and mapping from `in_feats` to `out_feats`, followed by a batchnorm layer.

This can be a bit fiddly to get right, especially if the names of your parameters are different to the names in the PyTorch implementation. We recommend you look at the `__init__` methods of the solution if you're stuck (since it's the order that things are defined in for the various ResNet modules which determines the order of the rows in the dataframe).\n",

In these cases, you'll need to resort to different debugging methods, like running the models on the same input and checking they give the same output. You can also break this down into smaller steps by running individual models, and by checking the shape before checking values. However in this case we don't need to resort to that, because our implementation is equivalent to the reference model's implementation.\n",

So we've now figured out what the problem is: **your implementation defines the right branch before the left branch in the the `ResidualBlock.__init__` method, and to match param orders with the PyTorch model you should swap them around.**\n",

If a parameter has its `requires_grad` attribute set to `False`, it means gradients won't be computed for this tensor during backpropagation. Thanks to PyTorch helpfully keeping track of the parameters which require gradients (using a structure called the **computational graph**), if we set `requires_grad = False` for the first few layers of parameters in our model, PyTorch will actually save us time and compute by not calculating gradients for these parameters at all.\n",

Commonly, powers of 2 are chosen for computational efficiency, and deeper layers might have more channels to capture complex features.

    "\n",
    "A \"max pooling\" layer is similar to a convolution in that you have a window sliding over some number of dimensions. The main difference is that there's no kernel: instead of multiplying by the kernel and adding, you just take the maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way multiple channels work is also different. A convolution has some number of input and output channels, and each output channel is a function of all the input channels. There can be any number of output channels. In a pooling layer, the maximum operation is applied independently for each input channel, meaning the number of output channels is necessarily equal to the number of input channels."
